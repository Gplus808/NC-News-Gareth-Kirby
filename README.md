Make two files in the main folder of the project.
One named .env.test for testing.
Another named .env.development for development.

Our .gitignore file has the relavent code in place to prevent these files from being pushed to your repo. However, please double check that your formating of these files matches that of the gitignore file as these databases may contain sensitive information.
